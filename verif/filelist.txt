# verif/filelist.txt

# File for Altair DSim Studio
# It collects all filelist files that list whole project source files.

# Note: You can use # to add comments to the file.
# The filelist*.txt is a manifest file that is synchronized to your workspace in DSim Cloud.
# The DSim simulator in DSim Cloud will consume this file.

# Order of files seems super-important and should be in dependency order. 
# Compilation passes regardless of the order, but elaboration fails if order is reversed.

# All Libs
-F ../verif/filelist.libs.txt

# All Testbenches
# Add `-F tests/testbench/filelist.txt` here for each new testbench.
# Testbench filelist should list all testbench packages and verilog files with `module` keyword
# and all DUT RTL files used in the testbench, but not the common / library files.
